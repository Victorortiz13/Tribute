	<h2> Summary </h2>
	<p>Johmney Depp is a funny and a good weird guy that you don't really take seriously. The characters he plays or acts all have a little something wrong in the head but he's really funny sometimes and most of the time when he's on screen or on set. He's pretty chill and laid back to so he's really just on of my favorite actors and my favorite one of his roles is when he plays Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Carribian.</p>
	<em>Funny, Chill, Relaxed</em>
